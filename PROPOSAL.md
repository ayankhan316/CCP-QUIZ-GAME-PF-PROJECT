Proposal:

Creating interactive and engaging educational programs helps learners test their knowledge while improving programming logic. To achieve this, we propose developing a Quiz Game in C, a console-based program that allows users to answer multiple-choice questions, use lifelines, and receive instant feedback on their performance.

This project demonstrates the practical use of fundamental programming concepts such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and variables. It aims to provide both entertainment and educational value while strengthening core programming skills.

Objectives:

Display multiple-choice questions for the user.

Allow players to use lifelines such as 50/50 and Hint, each usable once.

Calculate and display the user’s final score based on correct answers.

Provide clear feedback for correct and incorrect responses.

Make the game simple, user-friendly, and easily expandable with more questions.

We hope that this project helps beginners understand decision-making, input handling, and modular programming in C. By turning a simple quiz into an interactive experience, we aim to make learning C both fun and practical. This project can also serve as a foundation for more advanced game or education-based applications in the future.
